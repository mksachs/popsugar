# Popsugar Code Quiz
My solution to the Popsugar code challenge. The code is written in python. You can run it from the project directory using:
 
 ```
./popsugar.py
```

You will need an internet connection to download the log file. You can also have the code print out plotable data by running:

```
./popsugar.py --plot
```
